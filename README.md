## Assignment Overview

The task was to write a program that reads a CSV file containing song data, transforms the data into lowercase letters, and saves it into a SQL database. The frontend part involves displaying the data in a simple table ordered by the Band name.

## Database Connection and Deployment

During the development phase, I successfully established a database connection through the localhost, ensuring smooth interaction between the frontend and backend components of the application. However, while transitioning to the deployment stage, I encountered challenges related to the database connection. To address this, I attempted to resolve the issue by creating a new container specifically for the database within the deployment environment. Regrettably, unforeseen complications arose, and I encountered difficulties with the Docker Compose functionality, which hindered my progress. Despite my best efforts, these unexpected roadblocks unfortunately coincided with the project's deadline. As a junior developer, this experience has provided valuable insights into deployment complexities and the importance of proactive troubleshooting. Moving forward, I am eager to further refine my deployment skills and enhance my problem-solving abilities.
